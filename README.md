CU Research Computing (CURC) offers a variety of complex services that bring about a steep learning curve 
that can be difficult to climb. This presentation will go through the fundamentals of accessing and transferring 
data on CURC resources. Specifically, this workshop will discuss the various tools used to access data on 
CURC resources, transferring data using the command line, transferring data using a Graphical User Interface 
(GUI), and sharing data amongst other users of CURC resources. Please be sure that you have a CURC account
